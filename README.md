## Quickstart :rocket:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gidntsquia/MRC-ARL_Nav_Team
python3 main.py
```

IMPORTANT: Make sure to turn the motors on before starting! There is a switch on the back
middle right of the robot. A small red light near the switch will turn red and 
it will beep when the motors are on.

The robot takes a few seconds to load up, then it will drive
forward in a spiral shape! Note: the motor controller seems
to only fully turn on after the code is run once. Only then will 
the robot start driving. The motor controller is finnicky.

Team members: Addison Hanrattie, Jaxon Lee, Nicky Sremac-Saari, and Jordan White
